# What is Version Control?
* **Definition** sy# Whstem that allows you to 
       revisit various versions 
       of a file or set of files
        by recording changes. 
        Through version control,
         one can revert a file
          or project to a previous
           version, track 
           modifications and
            modifying individuals,
             and compare changes. 
             By utilizing a Version 
              Control System (VCS), 
              mistakes with files can easily be rectified
                * **Types of Version Control**
                    1. Local Version Control
                    2. Centeralized Version Control
                    3. Distributed Version Control 
                            ### What is github?
                           * **Definition** A DVCS that stores data in a file system made
                             up of snapshots 
                             * **What does it do?
                             1. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a 
                             reference to it 
                             2. If the file has not changed, 
                              Git only stores a reference 
                              to the already-stored 
                              identical version of it 
                              3. Git mostly relies on local operations
                              4. Every  change you make to a file or directory is tracked by Git, and it will detect any corruption or loss 
                              or imformation in transit
                              5. It is extremely hard to lose your data with git. It makes it hard to lose a snapshot of your file that has been commited 
                              6. Files in Git can
                               reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged 
                               7. Committed
                                    _Data is safely  stored in a local data base_
                                 8. Modified
                                     _file has been changed but not commited to the data base_
                                     9. Staged
                                        _Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed 
                                        in the next snapshot_
